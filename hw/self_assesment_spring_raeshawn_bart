My contribution was helping with the programming with the arduino for the baby seat alarm. I applied the thing i learned since last fall by looking at information like how to have an interactive weight sensor work and correspond with the car seat and weight

Next we programmed the arduino and used a small weight sensor in which we put between the car seat padding so that when weight is put in the car seat it registers whether or not a child is in the car. So our piece to put together this project was an android app alarm, a car seat, a power source for the arduino and a weight sensor. Some of the obstacles we were having was sending off an alarm that wouldn't cause public disturbance and initial starting of the weight registering code.

We accomplished a full prototype of a baby car seat alarm that shows when the parent left the vicinity and also the weight sensor to be able to tell if there's a child in a car seat.we built upon our knowledge since the fall by having to learn android studios from scratch and incorporating it into our alarm so it works with phones.

the aspect of teamwork was very appealing we worked well together and that we worked 50/50 with this project and helped each other so overall we complemented each other and when one was stuck on something the other provided input and also helped
