# UserManual

## Installation
The system provided by us is a weight sensor connected to a raspberry pi.
- Place the weight sensor inside the baby's carseat
- Plug the raspberry pi into a usb or cigarette lighter connection with the included adapters
- Configure the connecting wire so it does not interfere with moving items or people

The second component is an android app to act as an alarm
- Directions for app installation coming soon
- Open the wi-fi settings in your phone
- Connect to the wifi network: "babyseat alarm"
- If possible, set your phone to automatically connect to this network

## Usage
Usage occurs whenever you travel with a child in the back seat. If configured properly, your phone will connect to the network and query information about the backseat. If it senses a child in the backseat, it will remember. If you walk away without removing the child, the phone app will lose contact with the backseat and alert you that you never removed the child. When the child is removed, the phone app will sense this and not raise an alarm.
