## Project Description
A monitor and alarm that alerts parents if they leave their baby in the car

## Abstract
Forgetting kids in a hot car is an unfortunate mistake that leads to multiple deaths each year. According to [KidsandCars.org](https://www.kidsandcars.org/how-kids-get-hurt/heat-stroke/) 26 kids died in 2020 from this mistake and 53 died in 2019. While these numbers may not be a leading cause of death, these cases are very preventable and every life matters. In most cases, parents have a change in routine or may be very tired which can cause them to go onto auto-pilot, leading to costly mistakes.

## Current solutions
Many of Hyndai's [2021 models](https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3312) have a monitoring system that will detect movement in the back seat and alert the owner by sending a text message or setting off the car's alarm. This is probably the best solution to date and while Kia also has some models with this feature, it still remains that the vast majority of cars do not have this feature.

There are some habits that [KidsandCars.org](https://www.kidsandcars.org) suggests to prevent this from happening
- Open the back door every time you park
- Place an item you need to start your day in the back of the car like keys or a handbag
- Clearly communicate who is getting the child out of the car

## Proposed solution
Our proposed solution is to have a system that can be placed in a car to detect if a child is still in the car. This device will communicate with something that is kept on the parent's person. If the parent walks away, they will be notified that their child is still in the car. The device that the parent keeps could be something attached to their keyfob or their phone could be used. The device in the car could either look for movement or montior the child's seatbelt. These two devices must be able to communicate independent of surrounding networks.
