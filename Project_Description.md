## Project Description
A monitor and alarm that alerts parents if they leave their baby in the car

## Abstract
Forgetting kids in a hot car is an unfortunate mistake that leads to multiple deaths each year. According to [KidsandCars.org](https://www.kidsandcars.org/how-kids-get-hurt/heat-stroke/) 26 kids died in 2020 from this mistake and 53 died in 2019. While these numbers may not be a leading cause of death, these cases are very preventable and every life matters. In most cases, parents have a change in routine or may be very tired which can cause them to go onto auto-pilot, leading to costly mistakes.

## Existing Work
Many of Hyndai's [2021 models](https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3312) have a monitoring system that will detect movement in the back seat and alert the owner by sending a text message or setting off the car's alarm. This is probably the best solution to date and while Kia also has some models with this feature, it still remains that most cars do not have this feature.

There are some habits that [KidsandCars.org](https://www.kidsandcars.org) suggests to prevent this from happening
- Open the back door every time you park
- Place an item you need to start your day in the back of the car like keys or a handbag
- Clearly communicate who is getting the child out of the car

## High Level Solution
Our solution is a monitoring system that can be attached to a child's car seat. This system detects if a child is still in the car. This device communicates with a mobile app that is installed on the parent's phone. If the parent walks away, they are notified that their child is still in the car.
